# Y-maze Randomizer — Legacy (Tkinter)

The legacy desktop app lives at `code.py` in the repo root. It’s kept for reference; the modern web app is documented in `README.md` and lives in `modern-app/`.

Quick run (legacy):
```bash
python code.py
```
Requires Python 3 with Tkinter and `openpyxl` for Excel export (`pip install openpyxl`).
